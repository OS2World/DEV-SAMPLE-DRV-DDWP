                          USING SNOOP/2


MAKING CHOICES
==============

    The main problem people have when using SNOOP/2 for the first time
    is the menu system. The menu structure is split into two levels

        Level 1 - Select between one of three choices
            1) View OS/2 objects - device drivers, semaphores etc.
            2) View protected mode structures - gdt, ldt, call gates etc.
            3) General - Edit memory, disassemble memory etc.

        Level 2 - Select the specific item.

    IN ORDER TO SELECT AN ITEM YOU MUST FIRST MAKE A CHOICE AT LEVEL 1
    THEN AT LEVEL 2.

    There are three ways of making a menu choice :

    1) The slow way - Position the highlighted bar over the choice of interest
        using the space/backspace keys, make the choice by hitting the
        return key

    2) The best way - Type the number in front of the menu choice. So to
        view semaphores you would type 1 followed by 6. To view device
        drivers you would type 1 followed by 1 etc.

    3) The mouse way - Position the mouse over the choice of interest and
        click the left mouse button. Do not forget you must make a level 1
        choice first before you can make a level 2 choice


    In order to exit a choice there are three ways :

    1) Type the ESCape key

    2) Type the cancel key F2

    3) Click the right mouse button.

    To terminate SNOOP/2 there are three ways :

    1) Type the kill key F3

    2) Type Control C

    3) Use the Kill-By-Name program (bundled with SNOOP/2) to terminate
       SNOOP/2

    In all three cases you will be prompted with a Yes/No query to terminate
    or not.


DISASSEMBLE MEMORY - Choice 32
==============================

    The manual states that this is not implemented yet - it is. You must
    first provide the physical address to disassemble.


VIEWING OBJECTS
===============

    The manual does not document this but you may view many objects. First
    select the object of interest and then hit return. This way you can
    get a disassembly of a device driver, or view the data associated with
    a region of shared memory.
